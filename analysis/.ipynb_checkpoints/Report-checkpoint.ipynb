    "The KaVE Project originally was a German research program. Over the past 10 years, it evolved into a platform for research around recommendation systems for software engineering. Generally, they're interested in questions like how humans influence software engineering or how certain tools can support humans to better / more efficiently perform their tasks. \n",
    "Examples are intelligent code completion, interaction trackers or evaluation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KaVE are collecting and providing these data sets such that we can better understand what software engineers do / what they interact with / where their problems lie. With this data, we can try to see relations betweek the workign behaviour of developers (edit events, time, run test and results of them) and his efficienty / performance / productivity / habits /...\n",
