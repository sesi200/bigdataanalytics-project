    "#### Who constructed data set, when, why?\n",
    "The KaVE Project originally was a German research program. Over the past 10 years, it evolved into a platform for research around recommendation systems for software engineering. Generally, they're interested in questions like how humans influence software engineering or how certain tools can support humans to better / more efficiently perform their tasks. \n",
    "Examples are intelligent code completion, interaction trackers or evaluation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KaVE are collecting and providing these data sets such that we can better understand what software engineers do / what they interact with / where their problems lie. With this data, we can try to see relations between the working behaviour of developers and his efficienty / performance / productivity / habits etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the three data sets we extracted from the gigantic pile of possibilities are explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What do we want to learn from this data?\n",
    "From personal experience, we know how important it is to frequently build your code and run some tests. Only then you're able to link what you've done (i.e. what you've written, the edit events) to the outcome (i.e. (hopefully) working code, build and test run events). \n",
    "\n",
    "* often repeated advice: compile early, compile often\n",
    "* intuition: longer time and more edits between tests/builds = more chance to screw up\n",
    "* Is there a way to show that empirically?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal of this data analysis therefore is to analyze the link between the probability of Unit tests or project builds succeeding in connection with how much time has passed and how many edits were made since the last build/test run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to test the advice 'compile early, compile often' and the closely related 'test a lot' empirically. In order to do this we found three relevant events in the data: edit (code modified), build and test events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypotheses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build\n",
    "    * the longer a developer waits to build his code, the higher the probability that the build will fail\n",
    "    * the more edit events a developer executes, the lower the probability that the build will succeed\n",
    "2. Test   \n",
    "    * the longer a developer waits to run some tests, the higher the probability for test failures\n",
    "    * the more edit events a developer executes, the lower the probability for test success\n"

    "The data was originally available in individual json events, with great support for parsing with Java or C#. \n",
    "Using the accompanying Java examples we converted the JSON-formatted data into .csv files in order to have an easy import into Pandas Dataframes available.\n",
    "This resulted in a dataset consisting out of 3 different files, one for each type of event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more simple part of the preprocessing stage included discarding wrong, incomplete, and unneeded data, parsing timestamps into a Python-compatible format, and storing the data into new, cleaned csv files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Session Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge in the preprocessing stage turned out to be session splitting. In our dataset, each record describes an <i>event</i> in the IDE, triggered by a programmer. Now each event also contains a *sessionID* attribute. This attribute will be the same for each event triggered without the progammer closing his IDE or even shutting down his computer. So naturally, a session could range from a few minutes duration (e.g. if the programmer restarts his computer right away) to really long timespans. We could tell that some programmers close their IDE only for forced Windows updates. \n",
    "Because we want to track actual development time, we decided to call it a new session if no code was modified for five minutes. We did this by introducing a variable called `SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300`, which denotes how long a session can be kept alive without any events triggered by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this splitting of sessions to work, all 3 data files have to be considered and upon finding a session that needs to be split, all records from the same session with a timestamp greater than the splitting point will have to be split as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60\n",
    "\n",
    "record A: sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 16:00:00 - edit\n",
    "\n",
    "record B:  sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 16:00:30 - edit\n",
    "\n",
    "record C:  sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 18:00:00 - build\n",
    "\n",
    "record D:  sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 18:00:45 - test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first two edit events clearly belong to the same session, as the follow 30 seconds after one another. Record C has a timestamp much later in the day though. When our algorithm arrives at record C, it will assign a newly generated (unique) sessionID to the record because `recordC.timestamp - recordB.timestamp > SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Additionally, record D will still have the timestamp of the original sessionID assigned to it, which is now wrong since we split the session up beforehands. This means that we will have to find all events *after* the splitting point and assign the new ID to them as well.\n",

    "For the analysis of the relationship between the A) number of edits done or B) the time passed between two tests and the success of a test, we again want to have this \"stable\" state: We only consider the number of edits done after a successful test. Sessions that have zero passed tests won't be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the question arose how to define a \"successful\" test. There are two possibilities:\n",
    "- a test run is successful if all the tests were successful, i.e. passedTests over totalTests equals to 1\n",
    "- a test run is successful if at least 1 test was successful, i.e. passesTests over totalTests lies between 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided on classifying a test run only successful when 100% of the tests passed. With the second definition, the spectrum of a successful test would be too big (a test run with 5% passed tests would be considered just as successful as a test run with 100%). This decision of calling a test successful with 100% passing tests also goes along well with the definition of a successful build (there are no partial successful builds).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the probability of a successful test run, we need the two data sets \"df_edit\" and \"df_test\". The latter has a column \"testsPassed\" which gives us the information whether to consider a particular session or not: It has to be equal to the total numbers of tests run such that it reached this 100% passed tests.\n",

    "* For each sessionID:\n",
    "    - get all entries that have passed tests, i.e. that have testsPassed > 0\n",
    "* For each sessionID with a passed test:\n",
    "    - count the number of edits done until the next test run\n",
    "    - here, we don't differentiate passed or failed tests, since that's exactly what we're interested in. \n",
    "* Create a new DataFrame with the following variables:\n",
    "    - sessionID\n",
    "    - timeOfTestPass: timestamp when a test passed\n",
    "    - timeNextTest: timestamp of the next test run of this sessionID\n",
    "    - editsUntilNextTest: number of edits done from timePass until timeNext\n",
    "    - ratio_p_t: result of the next test run. Ratio = passedTestNext/totalTestsNext, i.e. the percentage of passed tests\n",
    "    - totalTestsNext: total tests run in the next test (which was at timeNext)\n",
    "    - testPassedNext: number of tests passed in the next test (which was at timeNext)\n",
    "    - nextTestResult: boolean which is true if 100% of the tests passed = test was successful, otherwise false\n"

    "First remarks:\n",
    "* Our classes (successful vs. unsuccessful Test events) are quite balanced. \n",
    "* They have similar mean, max and min values. However, the \"True\" class has way more samples - almost 5 times more.\n",
    "* While the average number of edits for successful tests is 10.6, the aveage for failed test is 11.4\n",
    "* Also the timePassed between a successful test and the next test is similar for both classes: on average 140 seconds for successful tests, 154 seconds for failed tests.\n",
    "* Interesting are the median values for the number of edits. Here we see that in 50% of sessions which had unsucessful tests, 0 edits were made until the next test (since median 1). If no changes are made, then it's obvious that the tests will also fail in the next test run. This could indicate that maybe a lot of those failed tests are actually the same one, where the developer didn't change anything to fix the test. We cannot say if the tests run are actually the same tests are before.\n",
    "* The median of the successful test class (3) surprises us too. It shows that in 50% of the sessions, less than 3 edits were made until the next tests were run. This seems like a highly frequent testing routine.\n",
    " * Interesting side note: Other examinations of the data found that there are a few developers (around 15%) that heavily work with Test Driven Development. Lots of tests could stem from this.\n",
    "* However our variable \"number of edits\" and \"time passed\" between builds events are strongly positive skewed.\n"
