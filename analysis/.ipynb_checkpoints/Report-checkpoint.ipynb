    "#### Who constructed data set, when, why?\n",
    "The KaVE Project originally was a German research program. Over the past 10 years, it evolved into a platform for research around recommendation systems for software engineering. Generally, they're interested in questions like how humans influence software engineering or how certain tools can support humans to better / more efficiently perform their tasks. \n",
    "Examples are intelligent code completion, interaction trackers or evaluation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KaVE are collecting and providing these data sets such that we can better understand what software engineers do / what they interact with / where their problems lie. With this data, we can try to see relations betweek the workign behaviour of developers (edit events, time, run test and results of them) and his efficienty / performance / productivity / habits /...\n",

    "#### What do we want to learn from this data?\n",
    "From personal experience, we know how important it is to frequently build your code and run some tests. Only then you're able to link what you've done (i.e. what you've written, the edit events) to the outcome (i.e. (hopefully) working code, build and test run events). \n",

    "The data was originally available in individual json events, with great support for parsing with Java or C#. \n",
    "We converted the JSON-formatted data into a tree .csv files using Java in order to have an easy import into Pandas Dataframes Python available.\n",
    "This resulted in a dataset consisting out of 3 different files, one for each type of event.\n",

    "The more simple part of the preprocessing stage included discarding wrong/incomplete data, parsing timestamps into a Python-compatible format, and storing the data into new, cleaned csv files. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Session Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge in the preprocessing stage turned out to be session splitting. In our dataset, each record describes an <i>event</i> in an development environment, triggered by a progammer. Now each event also contains a *sessionID* attribute. This attribute will be the same for each event triggered without the progammer closing his IDE or even shutting down his computer. So naturally, a session could range from a few minutes duration (e.g. if the programmer restarts his computer right away) to really long timespans. \n",
    "We wanted to bring some context to the sessionID and decided to introduce a variable `SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, which denotes how long a session can be kept alive without any events triggered by the programmer. This will also help in not diluting the pool of sessions.\n",
    "For this splitting of sessions to work, all 3 data files have to be considered and uppon finding a session that needs to be split, all records from the same session with a timestamp greater than the splitting point will have to be split as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60\n",
    "\n",
    "record A: sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 16:00:00 - edit\n",
    "\n",
    "record B:  sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 16:00:30 - edit\n",
    "\n",
    "record C:  sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 18:00:00 - build\n",
    "\n",
    "record D:  sessionID = 1, timestamp = 05.05.2020 - 18:00:45 - test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first two edit events clearly belong to the same session, as the follow 30 seconds after one another. Record C has a timestamp much later in the day though. When our algorithm arrives at record C, it will assign a newly generated (unique) sessionID to the record as `recordC.timestamp - recordB.timestamp > SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Additionally, record D will still have the timestamp of the original sessionID assigned to it, which is now wrong since we split the session up beforehands. This means that we will have to find all events *after* the splitting point and assign the new ID to them as well.\n"

    "First remarks:\n",
    "* Our classes (successful vs. unsuccessful Test events) are quiet balanced.\n",
    "* While the average number of edits for successful tests is 10.6, the aveage for failed test is 11.4\n",
    "* Also the timePassed between a successful test and the next test is similar for both classes: on average 140 seconds for successful tests, 154 seconds for failed tests.\n",
    "* Interesting are the median values for the number of edits. Here we see that in 50% of sessions which had unsucessful tests, 0 edits were made until the next test (since median 1). If no changes are made, then it's obvious that the tests will also fail in the next test run. This could indicate that maybe a lot of those failed tests are actually the same one, where the developer didn't change anything to fix the test.\n",
    "* The median of the successful test class (3) surprises me too. It shows that in 50% of the sessions, less than 3 edits were made until the next tests were run. This seems like a highly frequent testing routine.\n",
    "* However our variable \"number of edits\" and \"time passed\" between builds events are strongly positive skewed.\n"
